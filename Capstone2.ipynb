We are most interested in a location with very little competition. We would like to find a place that is in a popular area and is near the city.<br><br>We will use data science and gather information and tables to indentify a suitable location.

    "### RESULTS and DISCUSSION <br><br> Our analysis shows that even though there are many sandwich shop in the city of Toronto, Canada, there are areas of the city that are still close to the city and have a lot of population. Most sandwich shop are near the outside of the city, so it make sense to open a sandwich shot near the middle of the city where make people are. In the middle of the city, people are able to get to the sandwich shop without the use of a car.<br><br>To location that we found, is optimal for a sandwich shop because the density of the population is high. People can get to the location by walking or by bike, so the younger crowds can also enjoy the sandwich shop.<br><br> Also since there are not many sandwich shop location  near the center of the city, the competition will be low. Lower competition allows for more profits, which is a great thing for the sandwich shop.  "
